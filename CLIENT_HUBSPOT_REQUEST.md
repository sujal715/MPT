**Subject:** HubSpot Integration Setup - Need 2 Quick Details

---

**Hi [Client Name],**

I'm excited to let you know that your booking system is ready for HubSpot integration! This will automatically sync all your customer bookings directly into your HubSpot CRM.

**What this means for you:**
- ✅ All new customers automatically appear in HubSpot
- ✅ All bookings automatically become deals in HubSpot
- ✅ Everything stays in sync between your booking system and HubSpot
- ✅ No more manual data entry!

**I just need 2 small details from your HubSpot account to complete the setup:**

### 🔑 Step 1: Get Your API Key

1. **Log into your HubSpot account** (the same one you use for your business)
2. **Click on the gear icon** (⚙️) in the top right corner (Settings)
3. **Look for "Integrations"** in the left menu and click it
4. **Click on "API Keys"**
5. **Click "Create API Key"** (or copy an existing one)
6. **Copy the API key** (it will start with "pat-" and be quite long)
7. **Send it to me** in a reply to this email

### 🆔 Step 2: Get Your Portal ID

1. **Still in HubSpot**, go back to **Settings** (gear icon)
2. **Click on "Account Information"** in the left menu
3. **Look for "Portal ID"** - it's usually a 6-8 digit number
4. **Copy this number** and send it to me

---

**That's it!** Once you provide these 2 details, I can complete the integration and you'll have everything working together.

**Need help?** If you get stuck at any step, just let me know and I can guide you through it, or you can share your screen and I can help you find these details.

**Why this is safe:** These are just connection details that let your booking system talk to HubSpot - like giving someone your email address to send you messages. They don't give access to your actual data.

Looking forward to getting this set up for you!

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

Just checking in about the HubSpot integration setup. I'm ready to complete the connection as soon as you have those 2 details:

1. **API Key** (from Settings → Integrations → API Keys)
2. **Portal ID** (from Settings → Account Information)

Once you provide these, your booking system and HubSpot will be fully connected!
